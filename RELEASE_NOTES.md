üöÄ GCADE v1.1 ‚Äî The Arcade Expands!

Hot on the heels of our initial launch, we're thrilled to roll out a major content update that more than doubles our game library and adds a new layer of polish to the entire GCADE experience.

This release introduces three highly-requested classics, enhances gameplay with satisfying new animations, and fixes key bugs to ensure a smoother experience for everyone.

üéâ What's New? Three New Games!

We've added three new challenges to the arcade. Can you master them all?

### üß© Block Fall

A tribute to the timeless falling block puzzle game, reimagined with our signature sleek style.
- **Classic Gameplay**: Rotate and drop tetrominoes to clear lines and rack up your score.
- **Modern Features**: Includes a helpful "ghost" piece, a next-piece preview, and a satisfying hard-drop mechanic.
- **Multiple Difficulties**: Choose from Easy, Normal, or Hard modes to match your skill level.

### üóº Stack Tower

A true test of timing and precision! Tap at the perfect moment to stack blocks and build your tower as high as you can.
- **3D Perspective**: A stylish 3D view gives a great sense of depth as your tower grows.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Misplaced sections dramatically tumble away, while perfect placements are rewarded with a satisfying flash.
- **Responsive Layout**: The scoring display adapts beautifully for a clean look on mobile devices.

### ‚≠ï Tic Tac Toe ‚ùå

The definitive pencil-and-paper game, brought to the digital age.
- **Sleek & Minimalist**: A clean, modern interface lets you focus on the strategy.
- **Clear Feedback**: An animated strike-through line makes it obvious who won.
- **Perfect for a Quick Match**: The ideal game for a quick challenge against a friend or to test your own focus.

üíé Enhancements & Fixes

- **2048 High Score Animation**: The "Best" score in 2048 now animates when you set a new high score, giving you a rewarding visual cue for your achievement.
- **Deployment Fixes**: Resolved a critical bug where the new Block Fall and Stack Tower games would result in a 404 error in deployed builds. All games are now fully accessible.
- **Stack Tower Visual Polish**: The falling animations for cutoff blocks have been enhanced to tumble more dramatically, providing better feedback.
- **Updated Documentation**: The project's `README.md` has been updated to include all the new games.

We're incredibly excited to share these new games and improvements with you. As always, GCADE is an open-source project, and we welcome any and all contributions.

Thank you for your continued support. Now go set some new high scores! üïπÔ∏è
