# Game Center

## 1. What is the app?

A sleek, responsive, and modern game hub built from the ground up with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases a polished user interface and a collection of classic games, all wrapped in a scalable "Game Center" architecture designed for easy expansion.

## 2. What the app has

- **Dynamic & Animated UI**: A visually appealing interface with a subtle animated gradient background.
- **Multiple Games**: Features fully-functional versions of classic games like 2048 and Dino Run.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience on all devices, from phones to desktops.
- **Rich Gameplay**: Games include rich animations, state management (like undo and high scores), and achievements.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to be easily expandable with new games.
